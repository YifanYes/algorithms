# Algorithms

This is my pokedex of algorithms.

This repository contains a collection of commonly used algorithms implemented in TypeScript. Whether you're studying algorithms, preparing for technical interviews, or simply want to explore TypeScript implementations, this repository aims to provide clear, commented, and efficient code for various algorithmic problems.

### Algorithms Included

This repository will cover a wide range of algorithms, including but not limited to:

- Sorting Algorithms (e.g., Bubble Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort)
- Searching Algorithms (e.g., Binary Search)
- Graph Algorithms (e.g., Breadth-First Search, Depth-First Search)
- Dynamic Programming Algorithms
- String Manipulation Algorithms
- Tree Algorithms

Each algorithm is accompanied by explanations within the code and a description markdown file to help understand the logic and approach used.

### Installation

You'll need Node.js and the next packages:

```
yarn install
```

To run a specific solution:

```
npx ts-node typescript-file.ts
```
